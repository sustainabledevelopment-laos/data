{"STAT_CONC_DEF":"<p><strong>Definition:</strong></p><p>This indicator is defined as the proportion of time spent in a day on unpaid domestic and care work by men and women. Unpaid domestic and care work refers to activities related to the provision of\u00a0services for own\u00a0final\u00a0use\u00a0by household members, or by family members living in other households. These activities are listed in ICATUS 2016 under the major divisions \u201c3. Unpaid domestic services for household and family members\u201d and \u201c4.

Data on time-use can be collected through a 24-hour diary (light diary) or stylized questionnaire. With diaries, respondents are asked to report on what activity they were performing when they started the day, what activity followed, and the time that activity began and ended, and so forth through the 24 hours of the day. Stylized time-use questions ask respondents to recall the amount of time they allocated to a certain activity over a specified period, such as a day or week. Often, stylized time-use questions are attached as a module to a multipurpose household survey. The 24-hour diary method yields better results than the stylized method but is a more expensive mode of data collection. Data obtained from these two different data collection methods are usually not comparable, and even data collected with different stylized questions might not be comparable given that the level of details asked about activities performed might differ from one instrument to another, thus impacting the total time spent on a given activity.  </p><p>b)\tTime-use activity classification. Regional and national classifications of time-use activities may differ from ICATUS 2016, resulting in data that are not comparable across countries. </p><p>c)\tTime-use data presented refer to the \u201cmain activity\u201d only. Any \u201csecondary activity\u201d performed simultaneously with the main activity is not reflected in the average times shown. For instance, a woman may be cooking and looking after a child simultaneously. For countries reporting cooking as the main activity, time spent caring for children is not accounted for and reflected in the statistics. This may affect international comparability of data on time spent caring for children; it may also underestimate the time women spend on this activity. </p><p>d)\tDifferent target age population used by countries and age groups used also make time use data difficult to compare across countries.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>N/A</p>","QUALITY_MGMNT":"<p>N/A</p>","QUALITY_ASSURE":"<p>N/A</p>","QUALITY_ASSMNT":"<p>N/A</p>","OTHER_DOC":"<ol><li><a href=\"file:///C:/Users/BK/AppData/Local/Temp/5.Lao%20PDR%20Labor%20force%20Survey%202017.pdf\">file:///C:/Users/BK/AppData/Local/Temp/5.Lao%20PDR%20Labor%20force%20Survey%202017.pdf</a></li><li>https://unstats.un.org/sdgs/metadata/</li></ol>","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"<p>Department of Social Statistics</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE":"<p>29 April 2021</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>Base on the statistical law and the National Strategy for sustainable Development of Statistical System 2016-2020 and vision for 2030, Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) throughout the  Lao  Statistics  Bureau  in  cooperate with  Ministry  of  Labor  and  Welfare  has  conducted  the Lao  Labor  Force  Survey  in  2017.</p>","IMPUTATION":"<p>N/A</p>","FREQ_COLL":"<p>2022</p>","DOC_METHOD":"<p>N/A</p>","DATA_VALIDATION":"<p>N/A</p>","DATA_SOURCE":"<p>Lao Statistics Bureau</p>","DATA_COMP":"<p>Data presented for this indicator are expressed as a proportion of time in a day.
