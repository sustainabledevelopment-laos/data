Data on deaths are also widely available from countries from death registration data or sample registration systems, which are certainly feasible systems. Such data are crucial for improving health and reducing preventable deaths in countries. The main limitation is that not all countries do have such registration systems to date, and data need to be completed with other type of information.</p>","RATIONALE":"<p>The indicator expresses the number of deaths from inadequate water, sanitation and hygiene (with focus on WASH services) which could be prevented by improving those services and practices. It is based on both the WASH service provision in the country, as well as the related health outcomes, and therefore provides important information on the actual disease caused by the risks measured in 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3.</p>","ORGANISATION_UNIT":"<p>Department of Planning and Cooperation</p>","META_LAST_UPDATE":"<p>23 May 2021</p>","INST_MANDATE":"<p>WHO</p>","indicator":"3.9.2","target_id":"3.9","sdg_goal":"3","reporting_status":"complete","data_non_statistical":false,"graph_type":"line","indicator_sort_order":"03-09-02","indicator_name":"Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)","graph_title":"Mortality rate attributed to unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene (exposure to unsafe Water, Sanitation and Hygiene for All (WASH) services)"}
