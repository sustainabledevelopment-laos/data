According to the SNA, \u201cGDP is the sum of gross value added of all resident producer units plus that part (possibly the total) of taxes on products, less subsidies on products, that is not included in the valuation of output \u2026 GDP is also equal to the sum of the final uses of goods and services (all uses except intermediate consumption) measured at purchasers\u2019 prices, less the value of imports of goods and services GDP is also equal to the sum of primary incomes distributed by resident producer units.\u201d</p><p>Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP): Real GDP refers to GDP calculated at constant prices, that is, the volume level of GDP, excluding the effect of inflation and favouring comparisons of quantities beyond price changes. Constant price estimates of GDP are calculated by expressing values in terms of a base period. In theory, the price and quantity components of a value are identified and the price in the base period is substituted for that in the current period.</p><p>Employment: All persons of working age who, during a short reference period (one week), were engaged in any activity to produce goods or provide services for pay or profit.</p>","SOURCE_TYPE":"<p>Numerator: administrative data from Lao Statistics Bureau</p><p>Denominator: The Labor Force Survey 2017</p>","SDG_TARGET":"<p>8.2 Achieve higher levels of economic productivity through diversification, technological upgrading and innovation, including through a focus on high-value added and labour-intensive sectors.</p>","SDG_SERIES_DESCR":"<p>SL_EMP_PCAP</p>","SDG_RELATED_INDICATORS":"<p>N/A</p>","SDG_INDICATOR":"<p>8.2.1 Percentage of growth in labour productivity (GDP/per person employed)</p>","SDG_GOAL":"<p>SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth: Promote sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth, full and productive employment and decent work for all</p>","SDG_CUSTODIAN_AGENCIES":"<p>ILO</p>","REL_CAL_POLICY":"<p>2022</p>","REG_AGG":"<p>N/A</p>","REC_USE_LIM":"<p>Output measures are obtained from national accounts and represent, as much as possible, GDP at market prices for the aggregate economy.
